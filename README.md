This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is a simple blog website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Typescript. It allows users to:

- View a list of blog posts.
- Click on a post to read more details.
= See the author's name on each post.
The application dynamically fetches blog data from dev.to and is optimized for performance and responsiveness, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.



This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
